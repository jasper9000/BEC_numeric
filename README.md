# BEC_numeric
Numeric simulation of a 2D Bose Einstein condensate and its time evolution.
The imaginary time method is used to find the gound state of the condensate.

# TO DO
 - implement a stable way to save, load and animate very large amounts of array data, i.e. high resolution and many time steps
 - look at the time evolution without imaginary time, i.e. the real time evolution compared to finding the ground state
 - find eingenstates of the condensate for higher energies than the ground state
 - systematically analyze resulting ground states for different parameters
 - (maybe) look at and implement other ways to solve the GPE
